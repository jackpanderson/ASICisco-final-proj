Project overview:
  This accelerator aims to implement an auto-wah DSP module fully in hardware, with the intent that it could be integrated into a DAW
  or some larger hardware or software based system. This integration is achivable via RAM macros placed on the input and output of the system,
  which would allow a connected processor to write audio data to the input memory, then read the audio data back from the output memory once
  it has all been processed. The system is designed to run on 16 bit, 96kHz audio, which means it processes 96,000 individual samples a second. (wa wa wee wa)
  For some diagrams about how the technical side of things work, please see the link to the presentation we gave in class:
